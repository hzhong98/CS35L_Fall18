1.	The patch should theoretically improve performance because it removes
an if statement which marginally slows down the process in the pre-patched
version

2.	You just need to watch out for any other scripts that rely on the
functionality of 'ls' as they could technically go wrong if they made
use of the way the ls function worked before

3.	You get an index error because the function relies on the number
of lines in the file which is 0 for an empty file

4.	There's a syntax error when you run the function with python3 rather
than python because the IOError works differently for python2 and python3
